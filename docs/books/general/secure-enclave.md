#### Secure Enclave

- Secure Enclave is a hardware-based security designed to provide robust security by isolating and protecting cryptographic operations and sensitive data. 


Its functionality:

- Isolation: The Secure Enclave operates independently from the main processor, ensuring that sensitive data is processed in a secure environment thatâ€™s separate from the operating system and apps.

- Encryption: It utilizes dedicated encryption keys that are unique to each device and are not accessible to the rest of the system.

- Biometric Data Processing: In devices like iPhones, the Secure Enclave handles processing for Touch ID and Face ID, ensuring that  biometric data is kept secure.

- Secure Boot and Anti-Replay Capabilities: It ensures that the device boots securely and that encrypted memory is protected against replay attacks.

The Secure Enclave is a critical component in maintaining user privacy and security, especially when handling high-value operations like authentication and secure payments.
