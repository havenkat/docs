# Policy Administration Point


- A Policy Administration Point (PAP) is a component in an access control system, particularly within the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) framework. It serves as the centralized management interface where administrators define, create, manage, and update access control policies.

- Policy Authoring/Creation: Administrators use the PAP to create and define access control policies, specifying rules, conditions, and relationships between attributes.

- Policy Distribution: It distributes the policies to the Policy Decision Points (PDPs) for enforcement, ensuring consistency across the system.

- The PAP is essential for maintaining centralized control and precision in the management of access control policies, providing a unified interface for policy administration.
